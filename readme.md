# ü™ê APOD Desktop Wallpaper - COMP 593 Final Project

This Python project downloads NASA's **Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)** for a given date and sets it as your Windows desktop background.  
It also saves the image and related metadata to a local SQLite database and avoids duplicate downloads by comparing image hashes.
